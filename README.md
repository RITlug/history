RITlug Club History
============

This repository contains publicly documented information about the history
of the RIT Linux Users Group. This is not the whole story of RITlug; RITlug
also maintains archives of past meetings, eboard notes, and attendance which
are available on request to RITlug members and RIT affiliated individuals.

Information in this repository is *public*. That is, no private club
information such as budgets, accounts, etc should be added to this repository.

you do during your year? Help us out by submitting a pull request.
